This is my final app called Balfolder!!
You will need to be preregistered with AWS SES in order for the app to send emails to your email address. 
Also, when inputting the emails, please do not add any spaces between the emails and have them comma seperated.

The Code for Flask, AWS SES, and data handling is all located in server.py. The code for the emailandsend lambda function is in lambda.py.
